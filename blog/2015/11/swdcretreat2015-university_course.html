<h2>Motivation</h2>
Last year I <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002202.html'>asked</a> the <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/'>discuss list</a>
if anyone had any experience with turing the <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html'>software-carpentry lessons</a> into a university course.
Bill Mills <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002203.html'>mentioned</a> that two main hurdles revolve around politics and curriculum control.
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002204.html'>Ethan White</a>
and <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002211.html'>Michael Jackson</a>went on to describe their own experiences with settin up a course.
I want to believe the push for code sharing and reproducibility article from
<a href='http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261'>Nature</a> and submission guidelines for
<a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing'>PLOS ONE</a>
have addressed <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002205.html'>Greg's</a> initial observations that universites find that lab skills course is worth graduate credit.  The conversation contines
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002207.html'>here</a>,
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002210.html'>here</a>, and
a blog post by Damien Irving <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/02/university-course.html'>here</a>.

The Software Carpentry + Data Carpentry Instructor & Helper Retreat seemed like a good means to revisit the discussion.

<h2>The Roundtable Discussion</h2>

<emph>Earlier this year, Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff published <a href='http://physics.codes/'>Effective Computation in Physics</a>.
They have build a course around the book and Tiffany is doing a beta test of the syllabus in her <a href='https://phy3009.github.io/PHY3009-2015/'>course</a>.
Can you elaborate about the course?</emph>

been building off Katie and Anthony's expereinces from teaching as well as my own from teaching Software Carpentry.
Anthony also taught the course to Masters students.
I deided to use this txt book as my course at Quest. THe book is based on Python, but many of the priinciples are language agnostic.
THe book covers maby topics SWC teaches, such as Bash, Python, Make, documentation, licences, and many open science aspects.
they also created a github reepo of annotated ipython notebooks of the code in the book.
The annotations are aimed to help those who are using the book as instructors and/or students.

<emph>A reponse to my original discuss question revolved around administrative and university department politics on who should and can teach a course like this.
For example, some people mentioned that the computer science department will push back to any course involving programming.
How did you over come these hurdles, or any others?</emph>

[tiffany] This was not much of an issue for me because Quest is a liberal arts college, and this is essentially the only computer science ourse they are offering this year.

[jenny]I just sneak it into courses that are already on the books.  I have created a course from scratch, and it was a nightmare.
Teach it in courses that already have a number.  But that's not a longterm solution.
But it's better that you polited it in an existing course or a topics course.

<emth>How would other people go about politing a course like this?
[J] For example, I'm just a graduate student, would me getting a faculty to sponsor to run a special topics course be the only way to get started?</emth>
If omeone at UBC wanted to offer this and weren't me (with teaching someting or with rights).  Teach it as a variable special topics.
Or find a course that is related, and offer to teach a lap with them.  So the SWC stuff can be sold as a lab as anexisting course.
THis would also provide the added benefit of getting you paid as a TA, for example.

<emph>How do we turn the SWC course and how to fit that into 30 weeks.
Should we try to expand the current material into 30 weeks, or offer 2 half semester courses.
One of the concerns Bill Mills brought up was a 30 week course could too easily evolve/devolve into a Machine Learnig / Data science course.
Where SWC tries to teach fundamental skills.
How do we break up the current materal?
</emph>

[T] My curreny course is taught as a 3.5 week course.  This is supposed to be the same number of hours as a full semester course.
We covered abbreviated shell. 6 hours of version control.  Sincecode review was part of thecourse PRs was essential.  THese sessions were split up a week apart.
Then we covered all the Python basics.  Data munging and visualizations are really important, so we spend a lot of time with Visualizations and Pandas.
Because I think you learn a lot by doing, almost the last 9 hours of the course are done doing hack sessions, where I am around to help.
I am not teaching at this point.  THis is also because Quest perfers courses not to be lecturebased.  They want more activelearning.

[J] I'm not teaching classicSWC material. I am sneaking it into existing course.
One of the nice things about spreading out the material, is that you can makethe examples less artificial.
THis has alwasys been a complaint of mine.
Because you have to move through so much technical stuff, you end updoing a bunch of stuff with the file 'foo', and a bunch of other unrelistic problems.
A benefit is then, by spreading everything out, you give the students a chance to use an example that is not boring.

<emph>Jenny, how do you sneak and shim in the SWC material into your existing course?</emph>
I have a lot of material in both settings.  I use the2 courses asan excuse to develop each other.
I mainly teach R and data analysis.  So the part were SWC is helpful is Git.
I don't teach as much Git formally as I should, I maily teach things by doing.
I've never drawn the GIt concept maps when I teach.  Not sure if this is a good or bad thing.
They do end up manage to get the work done.  I haven't brought SWC material explicitly yet.

<emph>[t] In teaching these courses (I -- Tiffany come from a bio background).  If you are teaching SWC as a graduate or undergrad class, you have to assess people.
What qassignments and quizzes do you give so you can get an understanding of how much material they are learning?</emph>

[J] I don't do small quizzes.  I use to have big giant classes at the end, but this ends up with big heroic things happening atthe end of the course for both the students and myself.
THey would leave stuff at the end, and end up pulling 3 all nighters and not necessarily get it all done.
Iw oudl then get 40 or 50 projects that are not amediable to a single rubric.  SO i've evolved over the years to a HW assigments.
These HW assignments are more of prompts, and given once a week.  Small and steady work throughout the semester versus a massive project at the end.
Hopefully thisis more real live.
and have a pretty standard rubric and makes grading much easier.
Having TAs help too!
Peer review isinvaluable.  Using git and github infrastructure for commenting on cmmits and PRs.

<emph>THe book has physics in the title.  What department do we put this under? SHould we limit the couse to a particular major of studnets? or have have the course be completly free enrollment?
Jenny, your class is under stats, is your class closed off to just stats people? Who can take your class?</emph>
[J] My class is wide open to any graduate student.  I have undergrads, but I have to sign forms for them.
I have tables tables and figures that I will put in the etherpad.  Since I've been tracking the people who attend my course:
I've had people from 50different programs.  25 in at least 2 people.  So basically they are all over.
40% are cumulatively statistics.  Since I have all the incomingmasters sutdents.
Computational bilogy and bioinformatics are usually in taking the couse.
I think it's good to have this diversity in the class and noy be this hyper specific.

[T] For this course I was hiredbythe department of physical science.at Quest
So I am usingkatie and anthony's books.  Dispite physics being in thebook and course title, i have a wide variety of people who take my class.
There are only 13 people inthe class.  Classes cap at 20.
People are from all different aspects, people in biology, physics, oceanography, marketing, sociology.
We have a mid-block review for the course where the students provide feedback to the teaching.
THey started discussing the txtbook.
they all really liked the txtbook.  Very relevant to the class even if I was not teaching straight out ofthe book.
FOr example, I was more comfortable teaching the SWC Git material so this is what I taught in our Git workshops.
I used the inflammation dataset where katie and anothony used a differentexample.
So the book and class doesn not need to be catered to physicists.
THe book *is* very Python specific.
Shell and GIt would be relevant to other things, but more than half is teaching Python.

<emph>What does the first few weeks of the couse look like for your guys?</emph>
[J] I have the libery to teach data analysis.  The first thing we do is create figures using the clkeanest data possible.
This was the motivation bet behind the gapminder package in CRAN.
