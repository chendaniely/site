<h2>Motivation</h2>
Last year I <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002202.html'>asked</a> the <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/'>discuss list</a>
if anyone had any experience with turing the <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html'>software-carpentry lessons</a> into a university course.
Bill Mills <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002203.html'>mentioned</a> that two main hurdles revolve around politics and curriculum control.
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002204.html'>Ethan White</a>
and <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002211.html'>Michael Jackson</a>went on to describe their own experiences with settin up a course.
I want to believe the push for code sharing and reproducibility article from
<a href='http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261'>Nature</a> and submission guidelines for
<a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing'>PLOS ONE</a>
have addressed <a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002205.html'>Greg's</a> initial observations that universites find that lab skills course is worth graduate credit.  The conversation contines
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002207.html'>here</a>,
<a href='http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2014-September/002210.html'>here</a>, and
a blog post by Damien Irving <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/02/university-course.html'>here</a>.

The Software Carpentry + Data Carpentry Instructor & Helper Retreat seemed like a good means to revisit the discussion.

<h2>The Roundtable Discussion</h2>

<emph>Earlier this year, Anthony Scopatz and Kathryn Huff published <a href='http://physics.codes/'>Effective Computation in Physics</a>.
They have build a course around the book and Tiffany is doing a beta test of the syllabus in her <a href='https://phy3009.github.io/PHY3009-2015/'>course</a>.
Can you elaborate about the course?</emph>

been building off Katie and Anthony's expereinces from teaching as well as my own from teaching Software Carpentry.
Anthony also taught the course to Masters students.
I deided to use this txt book as my course at Quest. THe book is based on Python, but many of the priinciples are language agnostic.
THe book covers maby topics SWC teaches, such as Bash, Python, Make, documentation, licences, and many open science aspects.
they also created a github reepo of annotated ipython notebooks of the code in the book.
The annotations are aimed to help those who are using the book as instructors and/or students.

<emph>A reponse to my original discuss question revolved around administrative and university department politics on who should and can teach a course like this.
For example, some people mentioned that the computer science department will push back to any course involving programming.
How did you over come these hurdles, or any others?</emph>

[tiffany] This was not much of an issue for me because Quest is a liberal arts college, and this is essentially the only computer science ourse they are offering this year.

[jenny]I just sneak it into courses that are already on the books.  I have created a course from scratch, and it was a nightmare.
Teach it in courses that already have a number.  But that's not a longterm solution.
But it's better that you polited it in an existing course or a topics course.

<emth>How would other people go about politing a course like this?
[J] For example, I'm just a graduate student, would me getting a faculty to sponsor to run a special topics course be the only way to get started?</emth>
If omeone at UBC wanted to offer this and weren't me (with teaching someting or with rights).  Teach it as a variable special topics.
Or find a course that is related, and offer to teach a lap with them.  So the SWC stuff can be sold as a lab as anexisting course.
THis would also provide the added benefit of getting you paid as a TA, for example.

<emph>How do we turn the SWC course and how to fit that into 30 weeks.
Should we try to expand the current material into 30 weeks, or offer 2 half semester courses.
One of the concerns Bill Mills brought up was a 30 week course could too easily evolve/devolve into a Machine Learnig / Data science course.
Where SWC tries to teach fundamental skills.
How do we break up the current materal?
</emph>

[T] My curreny course is taught as a 3.5 week course.  This is supposed to be the same number of hours as a full semester course.
We covered abbreviated shell. 6 hours of version control.  Sincecode review was part of thecourse PRs was essential.  THese sessions were split up a week apart.
Then we covered all the Python basics.  Data munging and visualizations are really important, so we spend a lot of time with Visualizations and Pandas.
Because I think you learn a lot by doing, almost the last 9 hours of the course are done doing hack sessions, where I am around to help.
I am not teaching at this point.  THis is also because Quest perfers courses not to be lecturebased.  They want more activelearning.

[J] I'm not teaching classicSWC material. I am sneaking it into existing course.
One of the nice things about spreading out the material, is that you can makethe examples less artificial.
THis has alwasys been a complaint of mine.
Because you have to move through so much technical stuff, you end updoing a bunch of stuff with the file 'foo', and a bunch of other unrelistic problems.
A benefit is then, by spreading everything out, you give the students a chance to use an example that is not boring.

<emph>Jenny, how do you sneak and shim in the SWC material into your existing course?</emph>
I have a lot of material in both settings.  I use the2 courses asan excuse to develop each other.
I mainly teach R and data analysis.  So the part were SWC is helpful is Git.
I don't teach as much Git formally as I should, I maily teach things by doing.
I've never drawn the GIt concept maps when I teach.  Not sure if this is a good or bad thing.
They do end up manage to get the work done.  I haven't brought SWC material explicitly yet.

<emph>[t] In teaching these courses (I -- Tiffany come from a bio background).  If you are teaching SWC as a graduate or undergrad class, you have to assess people.
What qassignments and quizzes do you give so you can get an understanding of how much material they are learning?</emph>

[J] I don't do small quizzes.  I use to have big giant classes at the end, but this ends up with big heroic things happening atthe end of the course for both the students and myself.
THey would leave stuff at the end, and end up pulling 3 all nighters and not necessarily get it all done.
Iw oudl then get 40 or 50 projects that are not amediable to a single rubric.  SO i've evolved over the years to a HW assigments.
These HW assignments are more of prompts, and given once a week.  Small and steady work throughout the semester versus a massive project at the end.
Hopefully thisis more real live.
and have a pretty standard rubric and makes grading much easier.
Having TAs help too!
Peer review isinvaluable.  Using git and github infrastructure for commenting on cmmits and PRs.

<emph>THe book has physics in the title.  What department do we put this under? SHould we limit the couse to a particular major of studnets? or have have the course be completly free enrollment?
Jenny, your class is under stats, is your class closed off to just stats people? Who can take your class?</emph>
[J] My class is wide open to any graduate student.  I have undergrads, but I have to sign forms for them.
I have tables tables and figures that I will put in the etherpad.  Since I've been tracking the people who attend my course:
I've had people from 50different programs.  25 in at least 2 people.  So basically they are all over.
40% are cumulatively statistics.  Since I have all the incomingmasters sutdents.
Computational bilogy and bioinformatics are usually in taking the couse.
I think it's good to have this diversity in the class and noy be this hyper specific.

[T] For this course I was hiredbythe department of physical science.at Quest
So I am usingkatie and anthony's books.  Dispite physics being in thebook and course title, i have a wide variety of people who take my class.
There are only 13 people inthe class.  Classes cap at 20.
People are from all different aspects, people in biology, physics, oceanography, marketing, sociology.
We have a mid-block review for the course where the students provide feedback to the teaching.
THey started discussing the txtbook.
they all really liked the txtbook.  Very relevant to the class even if I was not teaching straight out ofthe book.
FOr example, I was more comfortable teaching the SWC Git material so this is what I taught in our Git workshops.
I used the inflammation dataset where katie and anothony used a differentexample.
So the book and class doesn not need to be catered to physicists.
THe book *is* very Python specific.
Shell and GIt would be relevant to other things, but more than half is teaching Python.

<emph>What does the first few weeks of the couse look like for your guys?</emph>
[J] I have the libery to teach data analysis.  The first thing we do is create figures using the clkeanest data possible.
This was the motivation bet behind the gapminder package in CRAN.
Then week by week we slowly work in the details.
We start from a 'happy' place.
edit readme on github.
editing git local then push.
Focus on small milestones with visual and tageable results.  motivated by success.
then slowly develop the tools underneith.
Have the luxury of doing this because it is a full semester 13 week course.
Thinking about motivation is really important

[T] I agree motivation is key to getting students enguaged and onboard.
My course is taught in 3.5 weeks instad of 13.  However during this time, this is the only course the students are focused on.
But you miss the ability to consolidate.  It's like a 3.5 week SWC workshop.
Katie, Anthony, Bill:
Anthony: teaches git right after the shell.  I did this in my couse as well.
I also wanted to use Github as a way to submit homeworks.
abbreviated shell -- just to navigate filesystem and create things.
Every night -- we learn sometihng for 3 hours, then they go home and implement it for their final project.
I did go with a big final project (maybe a lesson I'll be finding out soon).
day 1: navigate shell, create things, and shell scripts.  the hw was to create a shell script to setup the directory structure for the project.
day 2: Git, make a git directory of their final project, and build up from there.
Motivation: we did not get to visualization until near the end of 4th or 5th day.
I try to give a big picture in the beginning of class. -- websites hosted on github
show them organized code repository -- with formated readme and folder structure.
give them big motivation in the beginning.

<emph>The Gapminder dataset is in CRAN for the R folks, what about the Python people? Is there a CSV?</emph>
[J] The package itself contains the TSV in non https locations, and github
[T] *****Nancy Keukens***** from UBC has developed a gapminder lesson for Python for the women in science workshop

<emph>Jenny teaches a 13 week course and Tiffany you teach a 3.5 week course, How much time per week do you meet? And how do you split up the SWC material thoughout the weeks/days</emph>
[D] What are your opintions on a half-semester course.  Or do you think it's best to be a
[T] We do 3 hours of shell the first day.  3 Hours of git the next.
I think it depends how many active learning exercies you can get.  For me it took me 9 Hours to get through loops, functions, and if statements becuase I had  a lot of active learning exerciese becoase I wanted them to fully .
Testing took another 3 hours (in the third week of the course).
Essentially 2.5 weeks of SWC then we do code review.
Each student is given the other student's homework to review.  And I sit with them and they give me a summary of the pull request.
At the same time the rest of the class are working on their final project.

[J] I teach less classic SWC.  I have 3 hours with the students a week.
about 80% of the time is setting the stage with slides.
The rest is working in R.
The way I do it, most of the learning is in the homeworks.
The class is just enough information and guidence so they are not totaly lost during the hoemworks.

<emph>What final projects do you have the stuends work on?  Do you assign them a project or do they bring their own questions?</emph>
[T] I've been extremely flexiable with this.  I have them think about the ifnal project from Day 1.
Pick something in the area they are intested in (to keep them interested in) and have a research question with a hypothesis and
do something that requires a computer to do.  Again, these are undergraduates, so my expectations are not as high becuase they
do not have as much research expereience.
One of the rubric points is to have a Python script import data and save a plot or table from an analysis or visualization.
And have a record in either a Make or Shell script to make sure everything is reproduciable.
They also have a 2500 word report.  They need to be able desemininate information.
Finally a 8minute presentation as a iPython notebook.  Je

<emph>How much literate programming do you teach?  When do you teach it?</emph>
Literate programming is interweaving code with prose text.

[T] I get them coding in the notebook and slowly in the week I show them markdown cells.
They don't necessarily use them, but because they see me use them.
In the second week, they are asked to do a statistical analysis and in a markdown cell explain why they chose that test and
what the test means.
It's interesting to see them tell each other to use markdown cells in the peer code review.
They push each other to do it.
Their final presentation is in a Jupyter Notebook so they are well on their way to doing literate programming.
But I do not give an explicit class on it.

[J] I teach <code>rmarkddown</code> on Day 1.  It enables them to make a plot which gets them excited.
<emph>then</emph> you can make a webpage.  Then you can easily put it on Github.  It makes it extremely rewarding to the students.
The peer review is helpful becuase they can provide feedback to each other about the layout of the repository,
how easy was it to find scripts and understand what the code is doing, etc.
Constant interaction between people.

<emph>Grading code and technical work is difficult, how do you do it?</emph>
[J] One of other reasons of doing peer review is to get feedback to the students faster than if only the instructor is grading.

<emph>Jenny since you seem to have been doing this for a few years, do you have any availiable resources to share?</emph>
[J] My writing on the teaching of the couse has always been talks.
My Course is online, and I have speaker decks.

Ethan White's course

<emph>Software and Stats for biology is such a fast paced field, how do you even decide what to teach?</emph>
[J] The 2 courses I've taught the past decade is "Data Analysis" where I am chasing technology.
It's exhausing, but I also want to learn it myself.

I currently do the opposite in my "Genomics" class.  I did chase the technology for years, but every year almost required
a completely new course re-write.  I eventually generalized it to the key genomics pipelines and statistical analysis.
Multiple comparison, empirical bayes and try not to chase specific sequencing platforms.
"You can only be chasing technology a few places at a time."

Research wise, I've only been able to put these classes after I've gotten tenure.
This allmws me to put more effort into developing the couse with fewer outside distractions.
I would say what I'm doing would not mesh well with being super productive research-wise

***Jeff Leek***, Roger Peng, rafa irizarry, are doing online courses and super productive research-wise.


<emph>Do you have TAs</emph>
[J] An *army* of TAs is critical.  I have 6-7 (not all full time).
The department here was able to prove that this is not just a statistics class anymore, and people are coming from all over campus
So i got external funding for more TAs than the average graduate class.
I only have graduate TAs, no undergraduate TAs.

[T] Unfortuanlly Quest is a very new institute with limited funding.  So I am the only TA/Helper/Teacher/Office Hours.
This is a burden and barrier for the student's success.

<emph>My enrollment</emph>
[J] Strictly anecdotally, the people who are most vocal on github,
in class, and enrollment is disproportially female (in a good way!).
Which I find interesting.  The long dialogues I have with students on Github are my female students.
Contrast this with my more professional dialogues on github, which is mostly male.

<emph></emph>
[Cam] My university is putting a diploma for Library Techs, probably closer to Data Carpentry.
We still are figuring things out in terms of delivery, but really appreciate all the models of assessments and topics going on.
This is more of a general course which includes undergradutes.
